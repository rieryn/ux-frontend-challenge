#### Thoughts

Actual app is very straightforward

Stuff I tried out:

NextJS: Great! favorite framework now

MaterialUI: limited, bloated makes testing awkward

ContextProvider: not very useful here but yeah it's great  

Enzyme: it's a whole thing, idk https://kentcdodds.com/blog/why-i-never-use-shallow-rendering

#### todo:
```
refactor

tests

pagination

flip cards

banner 

responsiveness for mobile

nicer cards
```
